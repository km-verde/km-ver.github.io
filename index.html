                    Before college, I attended a magnet high school for medical sciences and research, 
                    and volunteered and interned at my local hospital. I also volunteered at local 
                    STEM events (e.g. olympiads, fairs, expos) to encourage more STEM education in my 
                    community. Though I'm not majoring in health sciences, I want to intersect my 
                    interests in <b>computer science with healthcare</b> to help better the conditions of   
                    medical technology and accessibility. Now, I still continue to volunteer in my community 
                    and also enjoy playing video games, baking, and watching horror movies.
